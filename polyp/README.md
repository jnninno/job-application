## 🌊 About

JOB APPLICATION is an experimental web game that questions the boundaries between:
- Job interviews and consciousness tests
- Corporate reality and pirate freedom
- Player agency and predetermined paths
- Portfolio showcase and narrative art

### Features
- 8 unique interview candidates, each representing a different lens of consciousness
- Multiple narrative phases: descent through corporate reality, void dissolution, pirate ascent
- Embedded portfolio pieces disguised as game artifacts
- Time-based death mechanics that enforce decision-making
- Compass navigation system based on philosophical cardinal directions
- ~15 minute complete playthrough

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

Built with a clean separation of concerns:

- **Skeleton** (`index.html`): Structure and game logic
- **Meat** (`meat.js`): All content and dialogue
- **Config** (`config.js`): Game settings and timers
- **Wardrobe** (CSS data-outfit system): Visual theming per game state

### Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript state machine
- No external dependencies
- Mobile responsive design
- Modular architecture for easy content updates

## 🎨 Future Enhancements

The current version is the stable skeleton. Planned aesthetic layers include:
- Typewriter text effects

- Glitch corruption for THE GLITCH
- RGB puppet voices for THE IDIOT
- Dynamic wardrobe transitions

## 📝 Development

### Local Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Open `index.html` in browser
